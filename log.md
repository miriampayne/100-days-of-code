# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made first commit to Memory Game project, adding an array to hold the cards. Learned how to deploy a website.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with confidence, starting off is difficult. Thinking linearly not the way to go about starting a project.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Have gone through some HTML exercises on FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy while travelling. Lots of progress on Memory Game today with 6 commits. Created and displayed cards, creating HTML, and added the icons.

**Thoughts**: Feeling great and a little more confident as today was so productive and I learned quite a lot by using tools I had learned in December.

### Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises on FreeCodeCamp, learned some things I hadn't covered before in other online courses. Added click functionality to Memory Game app.

**Thoughts** Where does the time go? Not impressed at how little progress made today but loving the support of my fellow onehundreders. Was frustrated and felt like pulling some hair out but their encouragement saw me through.

### Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Met deadline for a developer apprenticeship application test which involved diagrammatic reasoning and symbol processing. Worked on Memory Game but got stuck and made a slight mess, will need to use git to sort the 2 commits out.

**Thoughts** The practice run of tests went great, got all questions right. However the real thing had 50 questions and was timed, got stuck and so only managed half the questions which doesn't fill me with heaps of confidence. Very confused as to why my deck on Memory Game disappears when entering the if/else statement, it seems correct in my head but must be missing a declaration of some sort. Will need to mull that over some more tomorrow.

### Day 5: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Covered some Udacity course material for Part 3 of the Frontend Nanodegree program. Covered accessibility and focus. Forked a repo to play around with fixing the DOM order.

**Thoughts** Taking break from Memory Game today as not feeling the brain power to tackle it but feel like I did make some progress by carrying on with some theory and playing around with DOM. Have failed to publish last 3 days of blog, might have bitten off more than I could chew there - but as long as I'm getting some coding done, that's all that matters really.
